# Play Motion Builder

The Play Motion Builder project is an open-source tool that allows the design and creation of predefined motions for a robot, as well as an RQT-based GUI, and a Javascript library to interface with said node.

## Packages

### play_motion_builder
This is the main package of the project, containing both the data model and the main node for the project.

### rqt_play_motion_builder
This package contains an RQT-based frontend for the project, which allows simple control of the motion creation pipeline.

### play_motion_builder_js
